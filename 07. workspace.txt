workspaces is where you can build multiple, interdependent packages together all at once.

ROS relies on the notion of combining spaces using the shell environment.

catkin is the tool to build workspace for ROS

a space is just a physical folder, the name of which is spcified in environment variable, e.g.:
install/                -- INSTALL SPACE (set by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX)



--------- create workspace ------

$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make


"mkdir -p" will create several level path at one time, or it can only create one level at a time
