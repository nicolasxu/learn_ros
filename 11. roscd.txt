It allows you to change directory (cd) directly to a package.

e.g.:
roscd roscpp

e.g.:
roscd roscpp/cmake
roscd can also move to a subdirectory of a package or stack

Note that roscd, like other ROS tools, will only find ROS packages that are within the directories listed in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. 

e.g.:
roscd log
roscd log will take you to the folder where ROS stores log files.
